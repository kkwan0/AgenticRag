This form confirms eligibility for that graduation date if students meet all basic requirements (general education, one major, credits earned through courses taught by Duke faculty, signature work, and any additional requirements for students from Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). Students must submit the form by established deadlines.
