Question: What are the 7 principles of DKU academic advising
Answer: The 7 principles of DKU academic advising (as implicitly described) are:

1. Academic advising leverages curricular teachings with practical experience to assist with critical thinking and career readiness.
2. Academic advising promotes effective discourse between advisee and advisor that nurtures good decision-making practices.
3. Academic advising is an environment where advisees are responsible for charting their academic, social, and career pathways through inquiry, reflection, personal choice, and consultation with advisors.
4. Academic advising teaches ethical principles that promote holistic student development, authentic academic workmanship, innovative thinking, and research.
5. Academic advising teaches and encourages advisees to grow, discover, and enhance academic grit to persevere through academic and life challenges.

However, these 5 bullet points don't fully align with the requested 7 principles. Given this discrepancy and the provided information, it's unclear how exactly the seventh principle was supposed to be deduced from the text as only six principles were explicitly mentioned. 

Assuming that the sixth and seventh principles might not have been directly stated in the provided text but are somehow related to academic advising at DKU, we could attempt a speculative interpretation by drawing on general knowledge of academic advising best practices.

Based on this assumption, one possible approach would be to consider what typically falls under effective academic advising. For instance:

6. Academic advising fosters students' ability to navigate and adapt to changing environments and challenges.
7. Academic advising encourages collaboration between advisors and advisees in creating personalized learning plans that align with students' unique goals and aspirations.

Please note that these final two points are speculative and should be taken as an educated guess rather than a definitive answer.

This may prevent you from registering for future terms and could lead to administrative withdrawal from the University. Additionally, you may face restrictions on accessing academic transcripts, having credits certified, or receiving a diploma at graduation. In severe cases, your account may be referred to a collection agency and reported to a credit bureau.
