Question: What is the process for applying for graduation?
Answer: The process for applying for graduation involves completing the "Apply for Graduation" step in the Duke Kunshan University student information system. This officially notifies the university of the student's intent to graduate and confirms completion of all degree requirements, including general education, a major, credits from Duke faculty, signature work, and regional-specific requirements. Students must complete this step by established deadlines; failure to do so may result in administrative addition to the degree candidate list. Graduation confirmation details, such as diploma availability, are sent to the student's Duke Kunshan University email address.
