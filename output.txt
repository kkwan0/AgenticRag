Answer: Based on the available information, it appears that changing majors requires completing a certain set of courses or meeting specific requirements. However, there is no direct guidance on how to change your major based on the provided data.

The recommended electives and courses listed are for the current major, which seems to be in Behavioral Science (BEHAVSCI). If you were to take these courses, they would suggest that BEHAVSCI is a suitable major.

To change majors, it might be helpful to consult with an academic advisor or conduct further research on the requirements and electives for the desired major.

Question: What is the core curriculum for Computer Science majors?
Answer: Given the fields `context`, `question`, and the provided courses as part of the Stanford University computer science curriculum, we can deduce that:

- The core curriculum typically includes a combination of foundational courses in computer science.
- These typically include data structures, algorithms, programming languages, software engineering, discrete mathematics, and computer architecture.

Therefore, based on this information, we can infer that:

`[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`: There is no specific dissection required here as the context directly informs us about what's covered in a typical Computer Science major curriculum. Thus, it simply states "This requires knowledge of the course subjects covered by the major."

`[[ ## answer ## ]]`: The provided courses cover all aspects necessary for a computer science major:
1. Introduction to Programming and Data Structures (COMPSCI 201)
2. Discrete Math for Computer Science (COMPSCI 203)
3. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (COMPSCI 204)

Therefore, the full set of answer fields would be:

`[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
There is no specific dissection required here as the context directly informs us about what's covered in a typical Computer Science major curriculum.

`[[ ## answer ## ]]

Question: Can I do a literature review for my signature work?
Answer: Yes, you can include a literature review as part of your Signature Work process, as it is part of the background research required in your junior year. However, your final Signature Work product must go beyond a literature review. For Scholarly projects, this means presenting original research in a 25-30 page paper. For Creative/Design projects, it involves creating a substantial non-academic product (e.g., art, policy paper) with an explanatory text. The literature review is a step toward your final work, not the work itself.
